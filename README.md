#  Github Repository Finder (Assignment)

 A tiny, production-ready React micro-app that lets a user search and bookmark GitHub repositories.

üîó **https://powerplay-github.vercel.app/**  

---

##  Features

 This project meets all the core requirements of the problem statement, with a few thoughtful UX
 improvements:

-  **Live GitHub Search**  
   Search repositories with a 500ms debounced API call.

-  **Smooth Loading Experience**  
  Uses skeleton loader animation instead of basic ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù text.

-  **Persistent Bookmarks**  
  - Click the star icon to save/remove bookmarks.  
  - Bookmarks are saved to **localStorage** and survive reloads.  
  -  Saves the full repository object for a better UX.

-  **Bookmark Filter Toggle**  
  - **OFF:** normal GitHub search mode.  
  - **ON:** Shows all bookmarked repositories. When the toggle is ON and the user types in the search bar,
    the app filters and displays only those bookmarked repositories that match the search term ‚Äî enhancing UX.

-  **Clickable Repo Titles**  
  Open any repo on GitHub directly in a new tab.

-  **Error & Empty States**  
  Gracefully handles all cases ‚Äî idle, loading, error, and no results.

-  **Optimized Performance**  
  Uses `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to minimize re-renders.

-  **Clean Tooling**  
  100% TypeScript, ESLint + Prettier configured, **no lint warnings**.

##  My Write-Up: Decisions, Trade-offs, and Next Steps

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of my design approach and technical reasoning behind key implementation choices.

---

###  1. Key Decisions

**State Management (React Hooks vs. External Library)**  
I decided to use only **React‚Äôs built-in hooks** ‚Äî `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` ‚Äî for state management.  
For an app of this scope, this keeps the code **lightweight, clean, and performant** without needing Redux or Zustand.

---

**Architecture ("Smart Container, Other Components")**  
- `App.tsx` is the single **smart container**, responsible for all logic: fetching, filtering, bookmarking, etc.  
- Components like `ProjectItem`, `SearchInput`, and `FilterToggle` are **presentational only** ‚Äî they render UI and emit events upward.  
- This pattern improves maintainability, reusability, and debugging clarity.

---

**Bookmark Storage (Full Object vs. ID)**  
I intentionally stored the **entire repository object** in `localStorage` instead of just the repo ID.

- **Trade-off:** Slightly more localStorage space.  
- **Benefit:** Instant rendering of bookmarked repositories without re-fetching data from the API.  
  This also enables the **‚Äúsearch within bookmarks‚Äù** feature for a smoother UX.  
- Added an initialization check to **validate and clean up stale or corrupted data** from localStorage for better stability.

---

###  2. Trade-offs

**No Pagination:**  
The app fetches only the first 30 results, as specified in the requirements.  
While this limits browsing depth, it keeps the UX focused and the API usage minimal.

**CSS-in-JS vs. Plain CSS:**  
I used **plain `.css` files** for each component ‚Äî simple, zero runtime overhead, and easy to manage.  
The trade-off is that styles aren‚Äôt automatically scoped, but this is acceptable for a small-scale project and keeps dependencies clean.
